## Explaination
In class, I often faced issues with reading the soliloquies as I wasn't able to understand them, and the language was also very difficult to perceive. So, as a student with a flair for developing, I solved this problem with a Macbeth translation app. The app lets you dive into Macbeth's mental journey, giving you the chance to explore each soliloquy from different angles and uncover the layers of meaning behind his words. Each soliloquy is presented with three key components: the original text, an academic translation, and a brainrot translation that breaks down the complex emotions in funny language. The interface is designed to be intuitive, users can swipe between different soliloquies, toggle translation modes, and access psychological insights. As you move through Macbeth's soliloquies, the app tracks his mental unraveling. It's like watching him slowly lose himself, with each soliloquy marking a different stage of his moral decline. In the first one, before he kills Duncan, we see Macbeth fighting with his conscience. He’s not a monster yet; he’s just a man, scared of what he might turn into. He’s torn, grappling with the person he could become if he goes through with this. The app highlights his internal conflict, showing how ambition and fear are battling inside him. You can almost feel the moment he's about to cross a line he can't uncross. The dagger hallucination soliloquy represents his first real psychological break. It's not just about seeing a floating dagger - it's about his mind starting to fracture under the weight of what he's considering. The app visualizes this with subtle visual effects that show how reality is starting to blur for Macbeth. The soliloquy about Banquo's murder shows a more calculated Macbeth. He's moved from hesitation to active plotting. The psychological insights here show how each murder becomes easier, how he's losing pieces of his humanity with each decision. The app tracks this progression, showing how he's becoming more cold, more detached. The final "tomorrow and tomorrow" soliloquy is the ultimate psychological collapse. Macbeth has become completely nihilistic, seeing no meaning in life. The app presents this as a total emotional wasteland - where once there were hopes and dreams, now there's just emptiness. What makes the app unique is how it shows this progression. It's not just translating text - it's mapping a human being's complete psychological destruction. Each soliloquy is a checkpoint in Macbeth's descent, and the app lets you zoom in and understand exactly how and why he falls apart. The design is intentionally immersive. Dark, gradient backgrounds that get progressively darker with each soliloquy ultimately unfolding Macbeth’s true colors.
