    psychologicalInsight: `He's not just contemplating murder, but performing a psychological autopsy on his own potential for evil. Macbeth is pacing, restless, torn apart by what he‚Äôs about to do. He wants the throne, badly, but he knows killing Duncan isn‚Äôt just a simple action. It‚Äôs a point of no return. If he could stab the king and have it all end there, no messy consequences, no sleepless nights, he‚Äôd do it in a heartbeat. But deep down, he knows that‚Äôs not how this works. Right now, he‚Äôs still got a conscience. He can see the blood on his hands before it‚Äôs even there, and that scares him. He‚Äôs not a killer yet, he‚Äôs just a man staring down the edge of something dark, wondering if he can take that step.`,

The murder hasn‚Äôt even happened yet, and his mind is already playing tricks on him. The dagger isn‚Äôt real, but that doesn‚Äôt matter it feels like the universe is shoving a weapon in his hand and saying, ‚ÄúDo it.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt hesitation anymore. This is the moment right before a fall, when gravity takes over and there‚Äôs no stopping it. Macbeth isn‚Äôt debating whether he should kill Duncan he‚Äôs just watching himself become the kind of person who does.`,
