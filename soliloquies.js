      title: 'The Moral Crossroads',
      psychologicalInsight: `He's not just contemplating murder, but performing a psychological autopsy on his own potential for evil. Macbeth is pacing, restless, torn apart by what he’s about to do. He wants the throne, badly, but he knows killing Duncan isn’t just a simple action. It’s a point of no return. If he could stab the king and have it all end there, no messy consequences, no sleepless nights, he’d do it in a heartbeat. But deep down, he knows that’s not how this works. Right now, he’s still got a conscience. He can see the blood on his hands before it’s even there, and that scares him. He’s not a killer yet, he’s just a man staring down the edge of something dark, wondering if he can take that step.`,

      psychologicalInsight: `Reality and imagination blur, revealing the psychological toll of his moral corruption. He’s already unraveling. The murder hasn’t even happened yet, and his mind is already playing tricks on him. The dagger isn’t real, but that doesn’t matter it feels like the universe is shoving a weapon in his hand and saying, “Do it.” This isn’t hesitation anymore. This is the moment right before a fall, when gravity takes over and there’s no stopping it. Macbeth isn’t debating whether he should kill Duncan he’s just watching himself become the kind of person who does.`,

Banquo is the problem now too noble, too smart, too much of a threat. The prophecy said Banquo’s sons would be kings, not Macbeth’s. That thought eats him alive. But here’s the difference: before, he needed Lady Macbeth to push him. Now? He’s making the call himself. No moral debate, no hesitation just cold strategy. If Banquo’s in his way, Banquo dies.`,
